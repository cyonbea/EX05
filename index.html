    <h2>WALTER</h2>
    <article>
        <h3 id="c1"> The man behind the dust + </h3>

        <p>Walter is kind, caring and timid, but also demanding, calculating, and ruthless. His invented pseudonym, Heisenberg, becomes an alter ego; a fantasy for him to live out a love of power. Beneath both sides of his dual personality, he views the world in the rarefied scientific terms of chemistry, that go from his striking deep blue eyes to the blue crystal powder.</p>

        <p>Walter Hartwell "Walt" White Sr., also known by his clandestine pseudonym and business moniker Heisenberg and also frequently referred to as Mr. White, is a former chemist and major narcotics distributor from Albuquerque, New Mexico, whose drug empire became the largest meth operation in American history.</p>

    <article>
        <h3 id="c2"> The profession + </h3>

        <p>As a science teacher I´ll let you have some of the secrets behind my greatest recipe. The standard process for producing methamphetamine requires space. Meth labs produce quite a bit of waste products and involve the use of numerous appliances, such as pots and pans for heating, stoves or burners, hoses for ventilation, curtains or other blockages, so individuals from the outside cannot see what is going on inside. So I do it in a caravan in the middle of the desert as I may cook with only my undies and great views.</p>

        <p>You ask me if I was in the meth business, or the money business… Neither. I’m in the empire business. This is not a business, it is a lifestyle, a passion, an adoration for chemistry and the challenge of achieving the most pure outcomes</p>

<section id="HEISENBERG">
    <h2>HEISENBERG</h2>
    <article>
        <h3 id="c3">The alter ego + </h3>

        <p>Walt adopted the clandestine pseudonym and business moniker "Heisenberg" (referencing the theoretical physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg) as an alias as he immersed himself in the drug trade.</p>

        <p>Bryan Cranston said, "I think he takes on that name - and that look - in order to not recognize himself. That as long as he doesn't recognize the man in the mirror, he can sort of keep going." As his first action as Heisenberg, Walt throws a piece of fulminated mercury onto the floor, triggering a large explosion.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3 id="c4">The transformation + </h3>

        <p>Walt's transformation - his embracing of the dark and ruthless "Heisenberg" kingpin side of his personality - is a slow process that is advanced every time Walt crosses a line deeper into depravity (e.g. poisoning Brock).</p>

        <p>While initially heavily reluctant to use violence, Walt gradually came to see it as a necessity, and eventually developed into a ruthless drug lord motivated largely by vanity, ego, and greed.</p>
